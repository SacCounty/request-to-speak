## Contributing
Please read CONTRIBUTING.md for details on our code of conduct, and the process
for submitting pull requests.

## Versioning
We use [semantic-versioning][] to control the version of the app along with
[conventional-commits][] for recording changes in git. Then the two are wrapped
up and delivered with [standard-version][] to provide automation with the
version numbers and tagging the repo. Versions between the front-end and
back-end are different and independent of one-another.

Version 1.x of the front-end, may or may-not be compatible with version 1.x of
the back-end.

[semantic-versioning]: https://semver.org/
[conventional-commits]: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/
[standard-version]: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version
